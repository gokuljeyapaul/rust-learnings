// 1. Define a trait named `Bite`
//
// Define a single required method, `fn bite(self: &mut Self)`.  We will call this method when we
// want to bite something.  Once this trait is defined, you should be able to run the program with
// `cargo run` without any errors.
//
//  trait Bite...


// 2. Now create a struct named Grapes with a field that tracks how many grapes are left.  If you
// need a hint, look at how it was done for Carrot at the bottom of this file (you should probably
// use a different field, though).
//
// #[derive(Debug)] // include this line right before your struct definition
// struct Grapes...


// 3. Implement Bite for Grapes.  When you bite a Grapes, subtract 1 from how many grapes are left.
// If you need a hint, look at how it was done for Carrot at the bottom of this file.
//
// impl Bite for...
